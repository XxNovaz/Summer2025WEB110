<h2>Discover Saturn's Moon, Iapetus!</h2>

<p>Iapetus, Saturn's cratered moon,  was discovered in 1671 by Giovanni Cassini.</p>
<img src="images/Iapetus.png" alt="Drawn Iapetus" class="planet-image">
<br>

<p> This moon has been referred to the "yin and yang" of moons as the reflectivity of each hemisphere is 
vastly different from each other, giving a lighter/darker appearance for each side. While we are unsure why this is, 
we do have our guesses. It has been suggested that Iapetus is attracting bits and pieces from Phoebe (another one 
of Saturn's moons). Alternatively, there could be volcano-like eruptions spreading darker hydrocarbons onto the surface.</p>
<br>
<p> It is the third largest moon of Saturn and is estimated to be 75% ice. It has an orbital period of 79 days 
and Iapetus is tidally locked with Saturn, meaning that it's rotation period matches it's orbital period: meaning
 Iapetus is always facing Saturn with with same face. The same is true for the Earth and our Moon.</p>

<br>

<p>Due to the long rotation period, temperature cycles are quite long. This results in sections of materal to warm 
up significantly more than others and exacerbates the bright and dark areas, pushing each to their extreme.</p>

<br>
<p>If you notice my rough illustration of this moon, there is a large, circular crater on it. This has resulted
 in another nickname for the moon, the "Death Star", in reference to the popular George Lucas film, 
 <span class="web">Star Wars</span>. </p>
